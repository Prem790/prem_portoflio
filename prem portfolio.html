	<p style="color:#ffffff	"> <font size="5">Well being just a first year student, I can't define my work as skills, it is just some things I worked on in my free time. <br>
		-I know how to solve problem based questions in two languages JAVA and C. JAVA,  i studied  long time back and C recently. 
		worked on them, executing programs.<br> 
		-OutSide the syllabus i have a basic knowledge of JAVASCRIPT. I made notes, but I don't how much i remember.<br>
        -As there is no section of (skills you lack), I am an underachiever<br> when it comes to academic results, theory being my weakest part.<br> 
        -Outside books, My friends tell me that i am pretty good in sports and that i have a good taste in music also. <br>I don't know will it be considered as a skill.</font>
